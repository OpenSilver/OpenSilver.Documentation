# Migrating from Silverlight to OpenSilver: A Strategic Approach

Migrating from Silverlight to OpenSilver is a critical step towards modernizing your applications. OpenSilver is a robust, open-source platform that ensures a seamless transition while preserving your existing codebase, reducing risks, and optimizing costs.

Before initiating the migration, we highly recommend reviewing the [OpenSilver Overview](../general/overview.md) to fully understand the architecture, capabilities, and strategic benefits of adopting OpenSilver.

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

The migration process is systematic, leveraging a proven strategy that ensures consistency, efficiency, and a smooth transition. OpenSilver has been designed with this precise goal in mind—to allow you to maintain the integrity of your applications while upgrading to a modern, sustainable framework.

### **Key Migration Steps**

1. **Project Initialization:**  
   Start by creating a new OpenSilver project for each Silverlight application. This ensures compatibility and streamlines integration with the OpenSilver environment.

2. **Code Migration:**  
   Migrate your existing source code (XAML, C#, VB.NET, or F#) into the new OpenSilver projects. This is a direct transfer, ensuring minimal disruption.

3. **Compilation and Adjustment:**  
   Build your solution. While most features will compile seamlessly, you may encounter minor adjustments due to differences in the APIs. OpenSilver supports a vast subset of Silverlight’s API, but certain features may need to be adapted.
 
4. **Extract and Convert Business Logic to WebService/WebAPI (Only for WPF):**  
   During the migration from WPF to OpenSilver, you may need to extract and convert your business logic into a WebService or WebAPI. This step is essential to ensure that your application can communicate effectively with server-side components, since OpenSilver runs on WebAssembly and executes code in the browser, without direct access to server-side resources.

 

> ⚠️ **Important:** OpenSilver supports the majority of Silverlight APIs, but certain features outside of this set may require additional customization.

## 📦 Compatibility with Third-Party Libraries

Userware, the company behind the open-source project OpenSilver, is currently working on compatibility with third-party components and has already successfully implemented many components of the Telerik UI suite. Userware has also been able to reach a good level of support for RIA Services, PRISM, MEF, MvvmLight, SharpZipLib, Newtonsoft, and other Silverlight libraries.

> 🧩 **Tip:** If your application relies on libraries that are not yet supported, consider the following alternatives:
> - Rewrite the functionality in a supported language (C#, VB.NET, F#).
> - Replace the unsupported library with a .NET Standard equivalent.
> - Implement necessary functionality using JavaScript.
> - Directly integrate compatible JavaScript libraries.

## ✅ Advantages of Migrating with OpenSilver

The strategic benefits of migrating to OpenSilver, rather than rewriting your applications from scratch, are substantial:

- **Time and Cost Efficiency:**  
  Migration with OpenSilver is faster and significantly more cost-effective than a full reimplementation.

- **UI/UX Preservation:**  
  Maintain the original look and feel of your application, ensuring consistency for end-users.

- **Risk Mitigation:**  
  By retaining your existing, tested code, you minimize the risk of introducing regressions or unexpected issues.

- **Developer Continuity:**  
  Developers can continue working with familiar codebases, ensuring a smooth transition and preserving productivity.

> 💡 Migrated code remains nearly identical to the original Silverlight solution, making future updates and maintenance easier and more efficient.
