### Fixing cookie-related issues:

In a process of client/server communication there can be a situations when authentication cookies not sent to the server in subseqent requests by client and as a result server rejects to send data back.\
One of the reasons can be that client and server are running on different ports.


Here is the solution for C# code.

#### 1. Add the following line in App.xaml.cs (Client).

```Application.Current.Host.Settings.DefaultSoapCredentialsMode = System.Net.CredentialsMode.Enabled;```

#### 2. Add the following lines in Global.asax.cs in Application_BeginRequest function

```
HttpContext.Current.Response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:55591");
HttpContext.Current.Response.AddHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true");
```

55591 is assumed to be a port which client uses
