# Using the Photino Launcher with OpenSilver

Starting from version **3.2**, OpenSilver supports building cross-platform applications with **MAUI Hybrid**, allowing deployment to:

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **iOS**
- **Android**

However, **MAUI Hybrid does not support Linux**. To bridge this gap, OpenSilver integrates support for the **Photino Launcher** ([https://www.tryphotino.io/](https://www.tryphotino.io/)), enabling OpenSilver applications to run seamlessly on **Linux**, as well as **Windows** and **macOS**.

You now have the flexibility to build fully cross-platform OpenSilver applications:

- **MAUI Hybrid**: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android
- **Photino**: Linux, Windows, macOS

## Creating an OpenSilver Application with Photino Support

You can create a new OpenSilver application with Photino support using the command line, Visual Studio 2022, or Visual Studio Code.

### 1. Using the Command Line

Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
dotnet new opensilverapp -o MyAppName --usePhotino
```

2. Open your project folder in VS Code.
3. Navigate to `Program.cs` within the `MyAppName.Photino` project.
4. Press **F5** to initiate debugging.
5. If prompted, set `MyAppName.Photino` as the startup project to auto-generate `launch.json`. Press **F5** again to run your application.

## Publishing Your Photino Application

Publishing an OpenSilver application with Photino is straightforward and preconfigured.

### Publishing for Linux

The `MyAppName.Photino.csproj` file is already set up for publishing. Simply execute:

```bash
dotnet publish
```

The output will be a self-contained, Linux-ready application located in:

```
MyAppName.Photino/bin/Release/TARGET_FRAMEWORK/linux-x64/publish/
```

This folder contains an executable compatible with most popular Linux distributions.

### Packaging

Although the published output can be used directly, it's **recommended** to package the application using a native package manager for your target Linux distribution (e.g., `deb` for Debian/Ubuntu, `rpm` for Fedora/RedHat).

Proper packaging simplifies installation, improves user experience, and integrates the application seamlessly with Linux systems.

For detailed guidance on packaging and publishing, refer to the official Photino guide:
