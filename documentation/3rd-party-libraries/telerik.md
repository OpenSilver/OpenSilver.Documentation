# Telerik UI Support

## Status

To see a demo app of the current state of the 'Telerik UI for Silverlight' source code recompiled with OpenSilver, please visit the following URL:

https://opensilverdemos.azurewebsites.net/telerikshowcase/release

We are constantly improving OpenSilver until we will reach 100% support for the Silverlight API, so it is expected that the Telerik UI support will improve over time.

## Instructions
To use the Telerik UI controls in your own OpenSilver application, you need:
1. A valid license from Telerik for 'Telerik UI for Silverlight', which is available at: https://www.telerik.com/purchase/individual/silverlight.aspx
2. A license for the 'OpenSilver Compatibility Pack for Telerik UI'. To buy it, please contact us at: https://opensilver.net/contact.aspx

You can download a Trial from: https://opensilver.net/request-Telerik.aspx

Note: if you hire us to do the full migration of your application from Silverlight to OpenSilver, you won't need to buy the 'OpenSilver Compatibility Pack for Telerik UI' because it will be included in the migration package. Please [contact us](https://opensilver.net/contact.aspx) for more information.
### Specific instructions
#### RadMaskedTextBox
The RadMaskedTextBox has changed in a recent version of Telerik UI. If you are upgrading from an old version of Telerik UI, please read the following instructions:
